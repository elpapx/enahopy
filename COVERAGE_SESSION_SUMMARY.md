## 💡 Key Insights

### What Worked Well
1. **Targeted Approach**: Focusing on specific modules with <60% coverage
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Each test file covers multiple scenarios
3. **100% Achievement**: Geographic merger reached perfect coverage
4. **Quality over Quantity**: All 52 new tests passing on first commit

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Large Codebase**: 6,717 statements total makes overall % hard to move
2. **Complex Validators**: Geographic validators have many edge cases
3. **Test Dependencies**: Some tests blocked by missing 'responses' module
4. **Pyreadstat Issues**: 2 failing tests due to optional dependency

### Why Only +0.08% Overall?
The geographic merger module is only 17 statements (very small).
Even achieving 100% coverage there only impacts overall by ~0.25%.
The validator module is larger (181 statements) and we improved it by 16pp,
but it's still only ~2.7% of the total codebase.

**To reach 60% overall (+7.61pp), we need**:
- ~512 more statements covered (out of 6,717 total)
- OR improve several medium-sized modules to 60%+

---

## 🎯 Path to 60% Coverage

### Current Status
- **Current**: 52.39%
- **Target**: 60.00%
- **Gap**: +7.61 percentage points
- **Statements needed**: ~512 additional statements covered

### Recommended Strategy

#### Option 1: Focus on Large Medium-Coverage Modules (Best ROI)
1. **merger/modules/merger.py** (461 statements at 67.90%)
   - Already good, but push to 75%
   - Estimated: 20-30 new tests
   - Impact: ~2-3% overall coverage

2. **merger/core.py** (546 statements at 71.31%)
   - Push from 71% to 80%
   - Estimated: 30-40 new tests
   - Impact: ~3-4% overall coverage

3. **null_analysis/__init__.py** (193 statements at 64.63%)
   - Push from 65% to 75%
   - Estimated: 10-15 new tests
   - Impact: ~1% overall coverage

**Combined Impact**: +6-8% overall coverage
**Total New Tests**: 60-85 tests
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

#### Option 2: Fix Low-Hanging Fruit (Easier but Less Impact)
1. Fix 2 failing pyreadstat tests (+0.1%)
2. Add tests to multiple small modules
3. Reach 60% through distributed improvements

**Impact**: +2-3% overall coverage
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### Recommended: Option 1
Focus on `merger/modules/merger.py` and `merger/core.py` as they're large,
have good existing coverage (67-71%), and improvements there will significantly
impact overall coverage.

## 🎬 Conclusion

This session successfully improved test coverage for critical geographic modules,
achieving **perfect 100% coverage** for the geographic merger and significantly
improving the validators module. While the overall coverage increase is modest
(+0.08%), the **targeted improvements** were substantial (+57pp combined).

The path to 60% is clear: focus on large modules like `merger/modules/merger.py`
and `merger/core.py` where test additions will have maximum impact on overall
coverage percentage.

**Next session should target**: 4-6 hours of focused testing on large merger
modules to push overall coverage from 52.39% to 60%+.
